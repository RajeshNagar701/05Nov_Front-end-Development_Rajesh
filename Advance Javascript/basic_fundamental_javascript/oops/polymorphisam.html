<!--
The term Polymorphism is derived from the word “Polymorph,” where “Poly” means “Many” 
and “Morph” means “Transforming one form into another“. In Object-Oriented Programming, 
Polymorphism allows you to perform the same operation in multiple ways. 

It enables you to invoke the same method with different JavaScript objects by passing 
selected data members.

1) overloading :  use same name of function in diffrent ways in same class (Not work)
1) overriding :  use same name of function in diffrent ways in parent and child class

class B extends A  
  {  
    display()  
    {  
      document.writeln("B is invoked<br>");  
    }

      document.writeln("C is invoked");

var obj=[new A(), new B(),new C()] 
 
obj.forEach((msg)=>{msg.display();});
